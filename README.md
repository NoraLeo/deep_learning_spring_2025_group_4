# deep_learning_spring_2025_group_4
This is a project for 50.039 Theory and Practice of Deep Learning
How to run project:
1. Clone the repo
2. Enter the "new" folder for latest model
3. Run model-original.ipynb for model
4. Go to terminal and run 'pip install streamlit' and 'streamlit runn new/app.py' for User Interface

If there are any error it is due to dependencies. Ensure all dependencies in model.ipynb are installed and relative paths of "lstm_nvidia_model.pth" and "scaler.save" are correct for UI to run.
